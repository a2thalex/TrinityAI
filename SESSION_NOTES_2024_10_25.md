## üèóÔ∏è Key Architectural Decisions

### Claude Code SDK Agent System

The multi-agent architecture was designed with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Architect Agent**
   - Responsibilities: System design, database schema, API structure
   - Output: JSON architecture specification
   - Integration: Feeds into all other agents

2. **Coder Agent**
   - Responsibilities: Implementation of features and business logic
   - Output: Production-ready code files
   - Technologies: Adapts to specified language/framework

3. **Reviewer Agent**
   - Responsibilities: Security, performance, best practices
   - Output: Optimized and refactored code
   - Focus: Code quality and maintainability

4. **Tester Agent**
   - Responsibilities: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
   - Output: Comprehensive test suites
   - Coverage: Targets 80%+ test coverage

5. **Deployer Agent**
   - Responsibilities: Container configs, CI/CD, infrastructure
   - Output: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions files
   - Focus: Production-ready deployment

### Technical Implementation Details

```typescript
// Key workflow pattern
async generateApplication(spec: ProjectSpecification): Promise<GeneratedCode> {
  // Phase 1: Architecture
  const architecture = await this.executeClaudeCodeTask({
    agent: 'architect',
    action: 'design-system',
    context: { spec, workspace }
  });

  // Phase 2-6: Progressive implementation
  // Each phase builds on previous results
  // Full coordination through shared workspace
}
```

### Queue System Architecture

For large projects (>10 features), implemented Redis-backed Bull queue:
- Asynchronous processing
- Job status tracking
- Progress monitoring via SSE
- Graceful error handling

## üí° Insights & Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Claude Code SDK Integration**: The multi-agent approach provides excellent code quality and comprehensive coverage
2. **Queue System**: Essential for handling large code generation requests without timeouts
3. **Project Structure**: Clear separation between services enables parallel development

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Coordination Complexity**: Multi-agent coordination requires careful prompt engineering
2. **Workspace Management**: Need to implement cleanup strategies for generated workspaces
3. **Token Optimization**: Large projects can consume significant tokens - need optimization

### Technical Debt
- Need error recovery for partial agent failures
- Workspace cleanup automation required
- Token usage tracking and optimization needed
- Test coverage for Claude Code SDK service

## üìù Notes for Next Developer

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start all infrastructure
make dev-start

# Test AI Codegen service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8005/api/v1/codegen/generate-app \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @examples/todo-app-spec.json

# Check job status
curl http://localhost:8005/api/v1/codegen/jobs/{jobId}/status
```

### Key Files to Review
1. `/services/ai-codegen/src/services/claudeCodeSDK.ts` - Core agent orchestration
2. `/services/ai-codegen/src/routes/codegen.ts` - API endpoints
3. `/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` - Current progress tracking
4. `/docker-compose.yml` - Infrastructure setup

### Environment Variables Needed
```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY=your_key_here
CLAUDE_WORKSPACE=/tmp/claude-workspace
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```
