## üìù Notes for Next Session

### Priority Focus Areas
1. **Knowledge Graph Service** - Critical for fusion engine
2. **AI Graph Service** - Needed for LLM capabilities
3. **GraphQL Resolvers** - Required for API functionality

### Technical Decisions Made
- Using Neo4j for social graph ‚úÖ
- Apache Jena for knowledge graph (RDF/SPARQL)
- Weaviate for vector storage
- GraphQL as unified API
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Python/FastAPI for AI services
- TypeScript/Apollo for API Gateway

### Open Questions
1. Which LLM provider to prioritize?
2. Specific ontologies for knowledge graph?
3. Authentication strategy (JWT vs OAuth)?
4. Multi-region deployment approach?
5. Data privacy compliance requirements?
