# AI Awareness System - Project Summary

## 🎯 What We've Built

A production-grade AI awareness system that integrates three distinct graph models to achieve contextual understanding and personalized AI responses.

## 🏗 Architecture Components

### 1. Three-Graph Trinity System
- **Social Graph (Neo4j)**: Manages relationships, interactions, and social dynamics
- **Knowledge Graph (Apache Jena)**: Stores facts, ontologies, and reasoning capabilities
- **AI Graph (Vector DB + LLMs)**: Handles embeddings and generative AI capabilities

### 2. Infrastructure Setup
- **Docker Compose**: Complete local development environment with all required services
- **Microservices**: Modular architecture with separate services for each graph
- **API Gateway**: Unified GraphQL interface for all operations
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger for observability

## ✅ What's Implemented

### Social Graph Service (Complete)
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for users, relationships, and interactions
- ✅ Graph algorithms (shortest path, community detection, influence scoring)
- ✅ Recommendation engine for connections
- ✅ Real-time interaction tracking
- ✅ Redis caching for performance
- ✅ Prometheus metrics integration
- ✅ RESTful API with FastAPI
- ✅ Docker containerization

### GraphQL API Gateway (Partial)
- ✅ Apollo Server setup with Express
